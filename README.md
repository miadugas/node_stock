# Stockfluent

Stockfluent is a Nodejs web app that can help you to know about the Market Stocks of a Company and also helps you visualize that data.

# How it works ?

Stockfluent fetches all its data from a third party API.
For doing that, Stockfluent makes an asnyc call to API endpoints. It then aggregates the data received in response, does some data-marshalling for displaying them and also does some data-processing for drawing beautiful Visualizer graphs.

# Technologies Used:

Stockfluent is a nodejs app. For handling the routes, it uses expressjs framework. For displaying the data and rendering of views (HTML Pages) it uses express-handlebars. It uses HighCharts for drawing beautiful line charts for Stock Trend Visualizer. All frontend components are Bootstrap Components. Stockfluent also uses some custom CSS, font library of font-awesome 4 and some client side Javascript.
